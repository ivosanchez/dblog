Given this Model, the CMS will generate different types of input fields, groups, list, etc. that the editor can then fill in.</p><p>To simplify writing such a model, we provide a <a href=\"https://json-schema.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">JSON Schema</a> definition. Essentially, that defines the grammar that you can use to write a Data Model for FrontAid CMS using JSON. This page will explain how to use such a Schema and you can find more information about data modelling in the <a href=\"https://frontaid.io/docs/dev/model/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Model</a> section.</p>"
